Prerequisites:
maven, docker and docker-compose

To run:
just execute run.sh in the project's root directory

To see the results:
http://localhost:8080

You can also try
http://localhost:8080/delays/airport/SFO or other airport codes at the end

If you want to use different ports, alter the config/application.properties and docker-compose.yml files, it should be self explanatory
